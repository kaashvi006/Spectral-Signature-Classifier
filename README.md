# Spectral-Signature-Classifier
An ML tool to classify astronomical objects by fetching SDSS spectra and analyzing the light signatures of celestial objects using a Logistic Regression Model. The pre-processed spectral data is hence interpolated and used to train the model to recognize the celestial object using the captured light intensity in a specific wavelength range.
